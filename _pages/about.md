I am a second-year PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science. 

I am currently working with [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) on natural language understanding, and [Krzysztof Geras](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras/) and [Kyunghyun Cho](www.kyunghyuncho.me) on deep learning methods for breast cancer detection. 

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, where I majored in Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. I obtained my MS in Data Science at the NYU Center for Data Science in 2019. 

In Summer 2020, I was a Research Intern at Google Translate. I previously worked at AQR Capital Management where I applied machine learning to short-term alpha research as part of the Managed Futures team. I also previously interned at Old Mission Capital, doing research on high-frequency data.
