I am a fourth-year PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/). I am also a member of the [Alignment Research Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/) at NYU. I primarily work on transfer learning and natural language understanding with large-scale language models.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, where I majored in Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. I obtained my MS in Data Science at the NYU Center for Data Science in 2019. 

I am currently interning part-time at Microsoft on the Cloud & AI team. I was previously a student researcher at Google Brain and a research intern at Google Translate. 

I previously worked at AQR Capital Management where I applied machine learning to short-term alpha research as part of the Managed Futures team. I also previously interned at Old Mission Capital, doing research on high-frequency data.

I am also a researcher at [EleutherAI](eleuther.ai/).
