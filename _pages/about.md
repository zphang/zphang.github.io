I am a third-year PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/). I primarily work on transfer learning and natural language understanding with large-scale language models.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, where I majored in Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. I obtained my MS in Data Science at the NYU Center for Data Science in 2019. 

I am currently a student researcher at Google Brain. I was also previously a Research Intern at Google Translate. I previously worked at AQR Capital Management where I applied machine learning to short-term alpha research as part of the Managed Futures team. I also previously interned at Old Mission Capital, doing research on high-frequency data.

I also work actively with [EleutherAI](eleuther.ai/).
